## Aspects of Critical Thinking

### Intellectual Humility

To have the ability to realise that you're not always right and that you might have a blindspot or a bias. To constantly look out to when you are wrong.

### Courage

If you've done the research, gone through the problem, scientifically studied it, and you know that there's a specific solution but the majority of people don't believe it, you need to have the courage to fight for your reasoning.

### Empathy

Can you go into the mind of someone who is disagreeing with you and can see their viewpoint? With this you can come up with a compromise or direction where you both have a path forward.

### Autonomy

Are you able to independantly come up with your own ideas or is somethign else making decisions for you? Can you self-reflect and come up with your own viewpoint?

### Integrity

Are you playing fairly or using tricks to deliberately misinform people to buy your viewpoint? 

### Perseverance

Do you have the ability to methodically go through why your solution is the best and go through and make sure that your solution will the implemented

### Confidence in Reason

Do you have the ability to have faith in scientific facts? To believe that reason will win?

### Fair-mindedness

Are you accepting compliments or criticisms in good faith?
