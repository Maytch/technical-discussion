# technical-discussion
This is a demo repo for sharing ideas around communication

## Using GitHub, Gist, Colab 

### Gist

This is a gist example of [my code](https://gist.github.com/Maytch/33f6ea9ae697c933c44378b2c641de8c)

### Colab / Jupyter

## Aspects of Critical Thinking

### Intellectual Humility

To have the ability to realise that you're not always right and that you might have a blindspot or a bias. To constantly look out to when you are wrong.

### Courage

If you've done the research, gone through the problem, scientifically studied it, and you know that there's a specific solution but the majority of people don't believe it, you need to have the courage to fight for your reasoning.

### Empathy

Can you go into the mind of someone who is disagreeing with you and can see their viewpoint? With this you can come up with a compromise or direction where you both have a path forward.

### Autonomy

Are you able to independantly come up with your own ideas or is somethign else making decisions for you? Can you self-reflect and come up with your own viewpoint?

### Integrity

Are you playing fairly or using tricks to deliberately misinform people to buy your viewpoint? 

### Perseverance

Do you have the ability to methodically go through why your solution is the best and go through and make sure that your solution will the implemented

### Confidence in Reason

Do you have the ability to have faith in scientific facts? To believe that reason will win?

### Fair-mindedness

Are you accepting compliments or criticisms in good faith?


## Being an Effective Technical Triple Threat

Focusing on one skill/path isn't effective for your career. For job searching, a degree alone won't cut it. Having the qualification, a portfolio, and networking would be a triple threat.

## Effective Technical Discussions

* Sharing code that can be reproduced enchances conversation. Must run smoothly or else it can negate value. You can share code with gists / jupyter.
* Audio, video, and images to provide visual context
* Screensharing / casting to demonstrate and answer questions
* Produce once, reuse many
